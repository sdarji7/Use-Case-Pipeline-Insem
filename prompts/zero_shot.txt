You are a software engineer developing requirements for an {system_description}. Your task is to generate detailed textual use case models following formal use case authoring guidelines.

Instructions:

Identify all goals of the system and create a separate use case for each goal.

Follow the use case model rules from the provided document. Ensure:

The use case name starts with an action verb (e.g., "Book Ticket", "Search Flight").

Each use case has one primary actor and one or more secondary actors.

The main success scenario describes events sequentially with clear steps.

Alternative and exception flows are documented.

Use simple, declarative sentences with active voice.

Ensure proper structure, including:

Preconditions and Postconditions

Basic Flow (Main Success Scenario)

Alternative Flows

Exception Handling

Relationships Between Use Cases (Include/Extend)

Problem Statement:

{system_description}

Expected Output Format (Example Use Case):

Use Case: Book Airline Ticket

Primary Actor: ClerkSecondary Actors: Payment System, Flight Database

Preconditions:

The Clerk is logged into the system.

The customer details (name, contact) are available.

Postconditions:

Relationships:

Includes: "Verify Customer Details" (Step 2)

Extends: "Apply Promotional Discount" (optional in Step 5)

Your Task:

Generate all relevant use cases for the {system_description} by following this format for each goal identified in the problem statement. Be detailed and structured as per the use case modeling rules.
